    <p> Released in 1994,threw its way towards the gaming industry. 
      The Original playsation was released. During its startup, Sony at the time was in partner ship with Nintendo. However, Nintendo backstabbed Sony due to their disagreements. Nintendo later off went to work with Sony's rival company and started making Nintendo Playsations together. 
      While Sony presented their Nintendo Playsation, Nintendo at the same show the next day presented their own playsation. Sony saw this as an oppertunity to get back at Nintendo and began to work on a new consol.  This was a power move by sony, giving them nemerous of sales. By this time they had to rival sales against them seeing that only a few consols besides them released at the time. Everyone began loving this type of consol and adored how the controller feels. Sony even started using the latest and newest hardware that was out. Sony at the time was on top of the game even releasing major titles. 
      They were great on publishing great title games and even won awards for them. Even some games on this consol are remastered today.
       This early product introduced fan favorite games such as Twisted metal and Ridge Rider. Sony was way ahead of the Big generation consols such as Nintendo and Sony. Their sales sky rocketed way above them and was shown to be very succsessful.  However this was only exclusivly in japan for a while and then later released in the United States only a year after. Later, the playsation kept on producing the Playsation until March, 2005.  </p>

    <p> After the amazing success, Sony released the PlayStation 2 on March 4th, 2000. This time, PlayStation had  a brand new rival. One that would rival them for many years to come, Microsoft's Xbox. What made this console unique was it's use of its Dualshock controller. At first, Sony wanted a way where they can update each software at home using an update disc. This was later scratched. Another this that makes this very unique is its ability to streams movies. Using the cartage in the back, you could watch movie on your PlayStation. This at the time was very revolutionary due to this crazy idea. Sony was very fortunate to see an amazing start on release date. The PS2 sold over 1.5 billion copies and broke the record most sold console. This major success of the PlayStation 2 crippled Sega financially and competitively, forcing Sega to discontinue the dream cast on March 2001. Sony with their many rivals at the time continued to flourish. With this, Sony had a new idea to pull new customers in. They had the brilliant idea of making games exclusively towards their own game console. For example, Grand theft Auto and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Sony was doing so well infarct that they even cut their price of the PlayStation 2 from $299 to $199 in May, 2002. During this huge success, Sony immediately began working on a brand new console. This console would be well known for being a flop in the Industry.</p>

    <p> This new and improved PlayStation is the successor towards the PlayStation 2. This time they have two big rivals consisting of Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii. The PlayStation was released in November 11th, 2006, In japan. America would later have to wait about 6 days to get the release of the PlayStation 3. This console, like many, was publicly announced at E3. E3 is a place where many companies can pitch new ideas and talk to the customer about what's to come and expect.  At E3, it announced that it would have a Blu-ray Disk and would have many social gaming services through PlayStation Network. It offered connectivity between its counterparts, PlayStation portable and PlayStation vita. Some may say this is the biggest flop in console history. Sony's sales were disappointing and only sold as much as 85 million world wide. Many customers were disappointed at sonny's result of a console and started to movie towards their competitors. Many of the customers say that it was very high price and had a lack if quality games. While Sony may have saved themselves and prevented further loss, the damage was already done. Sony's PlayStation 3 was seen as the failed console in the industry. However, Sony never gave up. Many people were excited for it's Blue-ray feature and it was the winning factor in some customers. Many console reviewers even starting to rate the placation higher with ARS technica giving it a 6/10 and IGN titling it the best console ever.</p>
