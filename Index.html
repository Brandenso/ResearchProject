    <p> Released in 1994,threw its way towards the gaming industry. 
      The Original playsation was released. During its startup, Sony at the time was in partner ship with Nintendo. However, Nintendo backstabbed Sony due to their disagreements. Nintendo later off went to work with Sony's rival company and started making Nintendo Playsations together. 
      While Sony presented their Nintendo Playsation, Nintendo at the same show the next day presented their own playsation. Sony saw this as an oppertunity to get back at Nintendo and began to work on a new consol.  This was a power move by sony, giving them nemerous of sales. By this time they had to rival sales against them seeing that only a few consols besides them released at the time. Everyone began loving this type of consol and adored how the controller feels. Sony even started using the latest and newest hardware that was out. Sony at the time was on top of the game even releasing major titles. 
      They were great on publishing great title games and even won awards for them. Even some games on this consol are remastered today.
       This early product introduced fan favorite games such as Twisted metal and Ridge Rider. Sony was way ahead of the Big generation consols such as Nintendo and Sony. Their sales sky rocketed way above them and was shown to be very succsessful.  However this was only exclusivly in japan for a while and then later released in the United States only a year after. Later, the playsation kept on producing the Playsation until March, 2005.  </p>
